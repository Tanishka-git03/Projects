## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering on Multiple Datasets  

Welcome to my repository! üöÄ Here, I have performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering** on four diverse datasets:  

1. **Black Friday Sales Dataset** ‚Äì Analyzing customer purchasing behavior during Black Friday sales.  
2. **Zomato Dataset** ‚Äì Understanding restaurant trends, ratings, and pricing factors.  
3. **Flight Price Prediction Dataset** ‚Äì Extracting insights to predict flight ticket prices based on multiple factors.
4. **Netflix Content Analysis:** - Exploring content trends, genre distribution, and movie/show insights.

~ Project Overview:
<br>
<br>
* EDA: Data cleaning, handling missing values, visualizing distributions, and uncovering trends.
<br>
* Feature Engineering: Creating new meaningful features, encoding categorical variables, and preparing data for modeling.
<br>
* Visualizations: Interactive and insightful plots using Matplotlib, Seaborn.  
<br>
<br>
~ Datasets Used:
<br>
<br>
1. Black Friday Sales Dataset:
<br>
* Analyzing purchase patterns based on gender, age, occupation, and product categories.
<br> 
* Identifying high-value customers and most-purchased products.
<br>
* Handling missing values and encoding categorical features.  
<br>
2Ô∏è. Zomato Dataset:
<br>
* Exploring restaurant ratings, average cost, cuisines, and location-based trends.
<br>
* Feature engineering for price category classification and rating improvement insights. 
<br> 
* Data visualization to understand customer preferences across different cities.  
<br>
3Ô∏è. Flight Price Prediction Dataset:
<br>
* Analyzing factors affecting ticket prices, such as airlines, departure time, and duration.
<br>
* Feature extraction from date, time, and categorical variables.  
<br>
* Identifying key features for predictive modeling.  
<br>
 4. Netflix Dataset:
<br>
* It uses Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering.
<br>
* Analysis Netflix dataset (ratings, genres, release years).  
<br>
* Visualizes trends in content production and user preferences.  
<br>
* Identifies factors influencing top-rated shows.
<br>
<br>
# Tech Stack:
<br>
