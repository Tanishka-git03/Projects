## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering on Multiple Datasets  

Welcome to my repository! üöÄ Here, I have performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering** on four diverse datasets:  

1. **Black Friday Sales Dataset** ‚Äì Analyzing customer purchasing behavior during Black Friday sales.  
2. **Zomato Dataset** ‚Äì Understanding restaurant trends, ratings, and pricing factors.  
3. **Flight Price Prediction Dataset** ‚Äì Extracting insights to predict flight ticket prices based on multiple factors.
4. **Netflix Content Analysis:**

### **Project Overview**
<br>
* **EDA**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, visualizing distributions, and uncovering trends.  
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new meaningful features, encoding categorical variables, and preparing data for modeling.  
* **Visualizations:** Interactive and insightful plots using **Matplotlib, Seaborn**.  
<br>
### **Datasets Used:**
<br>
#### **1. Black Friday Sales Dataset**  
- Analyzing purchase patterns based on **gender, age, occupation, and product categories**.  
- Identifying high-value customers and most-purchased products.  
- Handling missing values and encoding categorical features.  
<br>
#### **2Ô∏è. Zomato Dataset**  
- Exploring restaurant ratings, average cost, cuisines, and location-based trends.  
- Feature engineering for **price category classification and rating improvement insights**.  
- Data visualization to understand customer preferences across different cities.  
<br>
#### **3Ô∏è. Flight Price Prediction Dataset**  
- Analyzing factors affecting ticket prices, such as **airlines, departure time, and duration**.  
- Feature extraction from **date, time, and categorical variables**.  
- Identifying key features for predictive modeling.  
<br>
#### **4. Netflix Dataset**
- It uses Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering.
- Analysis Netflix dataset (ratings, genres, release years).  
- Visualizes trends in content production and user preferences.  
- Identifies factors influencing top-rated shows.
